              <p>
                The only personal information we provide for our services that we collect from users who are below the
                age of 13 is permanent identifiers (such as device identifier, IDFA, IDFV, advertising identifier and IP
                address).
              </p>
              <p>
                Such permanent identifiers are used and disclosed to third parties solely to support internal operations
                aimed at ensuring the display of contextual advertising (including frequency caps), to authenticate
                users or to personalize content in the Applications (for example, to send push notifications), to
                maintain or analyze the functioning Applications, for the implementation of network communications in
                order to protect the security and integrity of user data of the Applications, as well as to comply
                safety standards or regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                When using persistent identifiers, we will not contact users under the age of 13, show them behavioral
                advertising, or use their data to track and profile. In addition, we make every effort to ensure that
                our advertising partners use the same standards for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data
                of children as we do, but we cannot be held responsible if they violate our promises to us regarding the
                collection of information
